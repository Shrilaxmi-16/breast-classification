## Description
This project focuses on the classification of breast tumors as either Malignant or Benign using various machine learning algorithms. Leveraging a dataset containing comprehensive tumor metrics such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more, we aim to build robust models for accurate tumor classification.

## Dataset:
- [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

The dataset comprises tumor characteristics such as radius, texture, perimeter, and other measurable features extracted from breast cancer images. These attributes serve as crucial inputs for training and testing the classification models.
