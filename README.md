## Description
This project focuses on the classification of breast tumors as either Malignant or Benign using various machine-learning algorithms such as KNN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Leveraging a dataset containing comprehensive tumor metrics such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more, we aim to build robust models for accurate tumor classification.

## Dataset
- [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

The dataset comprises tumor characteristics such as radius, texture, perimeter, and other measurable features extracted from breast cancer images. These attributes serve as crucial inputs for training and testing the classification models.

Final project for the **WQD7003 | Data Analytics** course at the University of Malaya

## Project objectives
- To perform preprocessing and exploratory analysis on the dataset.
- To build the classification model to judge whether the tumor type is malignant or benign.
- To compare the advantages and disadvantages of different classification algorithms based on evaluation metrics.
- To fine-tune and optimize the hyperparameters and improve the accuracy, stability, and execution speed of the tumor-type judgment model.
